This repository houses EXPERIMENTAL components for connecting HiWonder's LeArm system to ROS the Robot Operating System.
I am completely self-taught when it comes to both of these tools, so apologies if I am not adhearing to the standard practices.
Any contributions made in good faith are welcome, especially if they are documented enough for me to understand and learn from the changes proposed.
